# React + Vite

In this app:

I have taken external link for the user details to render
Initially the home page appears saying login
There just you need to enter your name and click the button login to go to main page(to test the button functionality i have included this)
in the next page you can see the header which is BrowserRouter linked to route into another page

here my main goal is to check the functionality of how we can change into different pages via links by staying in single page
